# desktopCleaner

Desktop cleaner application

Language: Bash

Application requirements

The application will have a yes no prompt upon execution. 

The application will create 3 folders if they are not already present.

The application will find the desktop path and set the desktop path variable.

The application will group the files in to videos, images and text files and then move them to their respective folder.


Potential issues

What if the file already exists in the folder, how will the application handle this? (It replaces the existing file)

At present this will be a Mac only application.

At present the application will move all the desktop files to the same dir that the script is held, this is not an issue for me personally but some people may not like this.
